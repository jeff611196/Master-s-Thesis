Analysis of the influence of traffic flow and power generation on air pollution

First, establish the XGBoost model. 

And then use LSTM model to predict future parameters.

Treat the parameters as the input of the XGBoost model.

LSTM built using the Keras Python package to predict time series steps and sequences.
